# Demand-prediction-of-driver-availability-using-multistep-time-series-analysis

Project Description

Food delivery supported through advanced applications has emerged as one of the fastest growing developments in the e-commerce space. We all love to order online, one thing that we don't like to experience is variable pricing for delivery charges. Delivery charges highly depend on the availability of riders in your area, demand of orders in your area, and distance covered. Due to driver unavailability, there is a surge in delivery pricing and many customers drop off resulting in loss to the company.

To tackle such issues if we track the number of hours a particular delivery executive is active, we can efficiently allocate certain drivers to a particular area depending on demand.
